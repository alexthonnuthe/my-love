      Hi, this letter exists because my heart needed somewhere to speak. So, I hope, by the end of this letter, you'll know how much you mean to me, Love.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's January 1, 2026, that I'm writing this. Love, we've been saying "I love you" to each other for almost a month now. I started 2026 with your "I love you" and I hope the year ends with us still together and starting another with each others " I love you"
    </p>

    <p>
      Kabalo ka nganong love tika? Well, no reasons behind it. I just love you, I won't be tired sa imoha. I hope I have given you an assurance of how faithful I am sa imoha. Love, unta ako ra ang imoha. I am hoping that you have chosen me not because I was the only option you had at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was admiring you since August 2025, and it felt so fucking good that you were the one who has been crushing on me first (which I haven't really confirmed) Anyway, Love, I am beyond grateful nga ge hatagan ko nimo ug chance. I am happy nga naa ka, your existence made every step I take within the campus meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love, ayaw kalimti nga you have someone who's thankful and proud to have you. Someone who wouldn't judge you when you show your weakness. Someone who will admire you for life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know I am not worthy enough to have you, and that I don't deserve you but I wanna contradict fate and be selfish karon. As long as you are still happy with me, I will still hold onto you.
    </p>

      <p>
        I love you, Mi Cielo.
